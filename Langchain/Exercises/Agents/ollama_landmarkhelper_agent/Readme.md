# LandMark Helper Agent using ollama

User can drag & drop a image of landmark and can ask any questions about that landmark.

Step 1:

- Once user drag & drops the image we need to identity what that landmark is.
- Once the landmark is figured out, we'll pass that to next step which will fetch the answer related to the question to that landmark which could be anything like nearest shopping malls, nearest coffee shop.
